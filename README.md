# Apple ]\[ repository
This repository will contain stuff related to the venerable Apple ]\[ computer. Mostly programming stuff. We'll see how it evolves.

The first thing I want to do is write some kind of guide or tutorial to write 2-liners in Applesoft and probably present some of the 2-liners I wrote.

Then I have several projects in assembly as well and maybe those will land here as well ...

Only time will tell.

## 2-liners
* [The art of 2-liners](https://github.com/tilleul/apple2/tree/master/2liners/the%20art%20of%202-liners): an incomplete attempt guide on how-to write 2-liners in Applesoft

## 6502
(this section will feature 6502 code, games and tips'n'tricks

## Tools
* [Bitmap Editor](https://github.com/tilleul/apple2/tree/master/2liners/bitmap%20editor): An Excel spreadsheet to virtually create and render Apple ]\[ sprites/bitmaps.
