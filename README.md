# Apple ]\[ repository
This repository will contain stuff related to the venerable Apple ]\[ computer. Mostly programming stuff. We'll see how it evolves.

The first thing I want to do is write some kind of guide or tutorial to write 2-liners in Applesoft and probably present some of the 2-liners I wrote.

Then I have several projects in assembly as well and maybe those will land here as well ...

Only time will tell.
