<img src="img/bitmap_creator_preshifted.png" align=right></img>
An [Excel Spreadsheet](https://github.com/tilleul/apple2/tree/master/tools/bitmap%20editor/src) to virtually create and render Apple ]\[ bitmaps/sprites. 

Works with MS Excel, Libre Office/Open Office Calc.

Fill in Apple ]\[ hires screen bits on a spreadsheet to create reusable bitmaps and sprites for your Apple ]\[ software development. 

Use the copy/paste features of spreadsheet to easily create pre-shifted shapes. 

The spreadsheet 
* renders the bitmap as a real Apple ]\[ (or more precisely like an emulator), 
* computes all the bytes values (so you can copy/paste them in your program)
* generates `POKE` commands to type in Applesoft so you can see how it renders in your favourite Apple ]\[ emulator.

Instructions are included in the spreadsheet.
