# Applesoft Two-Liners
Welcome to my Applesoft 2-liners repository ...

Here you'll find some 2-liners I wrote, with each statement described but also a [guide](https://github.com/tilleul/apple2/tree/master/2liners/the%20art%20of%202-liners), a tutorial, name it how you see fit, about how to write 2-liners in Applesoft.
