# Honoring The Code

Welcome to a new series of posts that will take a look at forgotten code, written by our elders and made public in several magazines of the Apple II golden era.
In each episode, we will rediscover an old program, written in Applesoft, or assembly, or both, and maybe sometimes in another programming language.

These programs will be of various interests as sometimes the description in the original article was more thrilling than the program itself !

For each program we will briefly describe how it works and, then, criticize the techniques used, and, finally, if needed, we will propose some improvements to the code so that it's more fit for today standards.

This serie expects you to have some basic knowledge of Applesoft, but nothing too fancy. If you're not familiar with Applesoft and are more comfortable with another brand of basic, this won't be an obstacle. From times to times, the code we review will use some assembly routines. 6502 assembly is not hard to learn but it's definitely less intuitive than Basic, so, whenever possible we will explain how the assembly routines work as if you never learned assembly.
