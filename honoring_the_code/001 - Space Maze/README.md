# Honoring The Code, part 1: Space Maze
Space Maze by Micro-Sparc, as published in Nibble Magazine #1, Jan-Feb 1980.

For this first episode I've chosen the very first issue of Nibble magazine, dating back to Jan-Feb 1980 ! Were you one of the lucky one to own a copy of this issue back then ? Well, I wasn't. At the time, I was only 5 and I'm not even sure we had an Apple II at home then. And also, Nibble was a US magazine that came to Europe (I'm from Belgium) mostly through their Nibble Express compendiums.

Although I did not have this issue, for a reason or another, the program we'll be talking about came to me through a disk(ette) of various basic programs. I remember vividly the graphics and the Star Wars music. Unfortunately, as we will see, the game is terrible. It's terrible today but it was also terrible back then.

Let me present you SPACE MAZE !

Here's a link to the DSK file that contains the code (among others): https://archive.org/download/nibbledisks_nib01/nib01.dsk

And here are two screenshots of the game:
